## About FRSecAPP

A facial recognition application that scans the person in front of
the camera and notifies the user about said person. If the person is in front of the camera
for the first time, the user has the option to either mark him/her as a registered contact, or mark him/her as an unknown person.

In this manner, the user is notified through a mobile application as to whether an anonymous,
unknown or known person is in front of the camera.

This application is being developed with the intent of security purposes, therefore the
ideal location of the camera would either be outside of users bedroom door or residence door.
